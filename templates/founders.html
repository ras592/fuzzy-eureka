				<p>Although I am not a photographer by trade, my desire to build a platform that would allow independent photographers 
					to build their business under a single brand led me to Old Westfield Photography. The opportunity to work on a cloud-based platform that centralized media storage and simplified payments has been extremely rewarding. I look forward
					to delivering an increasingly sophisticated, yet simple to use platform for our users.</p>

				<h3>LORRAIE Y.HARRITY</h3>
				<h4>Senior Photographer</h4>
				<p>Lorraine started to learn photography by herself since 15 years old and got her very first camera two years later. She took every chance to practice and consistently learned from others, which helped her to lay the foundation for her future. After graduating from SVA (School of Visual Arts), she was offered an internship position to work at Vogue, where she also began her career as a cover photographer. Her hard work and discipline paid off and she got many opportunities to contact with variety photography styles, which allowed her to enhance skills further and evolve her personal style generally. At Old Westfield Photography, Lorraine’s majority work is to photograph based on customers’ requirements and help other photographers who want to start their own businesses with the use of the Old Westfield platform.</p>
