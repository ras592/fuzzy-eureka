			<h2>The Mission</h2>
			<p>Old Westfield Photography is essentially a group that helps photographers get their feet wet in the business of photography. &nbsp;Our goal is to provide very affordable photography by using talented&nbsp;students and self-taught photographers who can't afford the start-up costs&nbsp;or don't know how to start a business as a freelance photographer.&nbsp; We are here to get them noticed. We provide&nbsp;the right tools to these&nbsp;photographers so they could one day start their own freelance photography business or at least build their portfolio and make some money.</p>

			<h2>What we photograph</h2>

			<p>By having extremely competitive prices we hope it opens the door to everything. &nbsp;If it can be photographed we would love to take the picture, whether it's for a birthday, a sports event, a new portrait, stock pictures or even for commercial use. &nbsp;See our services page to get a full spectrum of what we photograph and some of our recent work.</p>

			<h2>our tools</h2>
